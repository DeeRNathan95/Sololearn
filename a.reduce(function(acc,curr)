var a = [1, 2, 3, 4];
var b = a.reduce(function(acc, curr) {
  return acc + curr;
}, 1);
console.log(b);

Answer is 11

=============================================================

.reduce() is a method on arrays that lets you combine all elements into a single value — like summing numbers, merging strings, or building objects.

array.reduce(callback, initialValue);
- callback is a function that runs once for each element
- It receives:
- acc → the accumulator (running total)
- curr → the current item in the array
- initialValue is what acc starts as

What the Function Does
Each time .reduce() loops through the array, it calls your function to decide:
“How do I combine acc and curr?”

So this:
function(acc, curr) {
  return acc + curr;
}
