what will be alerted?
alert("1" - "1");

=============================================

Correct Answer: 0
🧠 Why?
Even though both "1" values are strings, the - operator in JavaScript forces numeric conversion:
"1" - "1" → 1 - 1 → 0


Unlike the + operator (which can trigger string concatenation), the - operator only works with numbers, so JavaScript automatically converts both "1" strings to numbers before subtracting.
