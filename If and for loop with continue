var y = 0;
for (var x = 0; x < 3; x++) {
    if (x == 2) {
        x = 5;
        continue;
    }
    y++;
}
document.write(y);


Output is 2

=============

Why the output is 2:

x = 0 → condition not met → y++ → y = 1

x = 1 → condition not met → y++ → y = 2

x = 2 → condition is met

x becomes 5

continue skips y++

Loop condition x < 3 fails → loop ends

So the final value of y is:

✅ 2
